# Virtual Background Replacement using MediaPipe

This project implements a simple virtual background replacement system using OpenCV and MediaPipe's Selfie Segmentation. It captures webcam input, segments the person from the background in real-time, and replaces the background with a custom image.

## Features

- Real-time background replacement using webcam feed.
- Utilizes MediaPipe's `SelfieSegmentation` for person segmentation.
- Custom background image support.
- Lightweight and efficient implementation.

## Requirements

- Python 3.7+
- OpenCV
- MediaPipe
- NumPy
